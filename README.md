# LeafGuard-AI
CNN-Based Plant Disease Classification Application

A computer vision model trained to detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This notebook-based project demonstrates real-time classification, batch image preprocessing, performance evaluation, and color-coded disease mapping for actionable insights. 

**Note**: This is a simplified version for demonstration. Trained models are not included. The full deployed application includes a polished UI and extended features but is not public. A recorded demo of the full application in execution is available on request.

## üìå Project Overview

This project is designed to help detect crop diseases early, enabling intervention before outbreaks spread. It supports both binary and multi-class classification of common plant diseases using deep learning.

**Key Features:**
- ~99.5% accuracy for binary classification (healthy vs. diseased)
- ~95% accuracy across 38 disease classes
- Batch image classification and simple GUI (Jupyter Widgets)
- Field-mapping logic (prototype version)

---

## üß† Model Architecture

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with regularization
- Trained on the **PlantVillage dataset** with ~54K labeled images
- Augmentation pipeline for real-world variability
- Early stopping and checkpointing to prevent overfitting

## üìä Results

| Metric            | Value     |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Binary Accuracy   | ~99.5%    |
| Multi-Class Accuracy | ~95%   |
| F1 Score          | High across all classes |
| False Positives   | Minimal (due to augmentation & regularization) |
